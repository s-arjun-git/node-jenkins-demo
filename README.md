# Node.js App with Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

This project demonstrates a simple Node.js app deployed using Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub.

## How it works

- Jenkins pulls the repo
- Builds Docker image
- (Optionally) runs tests
- Deploys the app as a container

Visit `http://localhost:3000` after deployment.
